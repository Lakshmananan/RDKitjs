This is the ToDo list


Need to find a way to have hierarchical Classes for example Molecule.Descriptors.

Need to have a Molecule.AllDescriptors to generate all of them (... list key:value).

How to use the  -s "EXPORT_NAME='RDKitjs'" to rename Module to RDKitjs in the js script also need to look at pre.js / post.js?
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30152622/changing-the-default-namespace-module-in-emscripten/30153119#30153119)

General question: how to /can we handle two molecules in JS (for Tanimotosimilarity(mol1,mol2) = 0.78) ?


Look at the python getstart rdkit page for a list of missing functionnalities.

Status:

DONE Reading and Writing Molecules: DONE, ok, don't need to implement files readers for the moment
Reading sets of molecules: need to do that (not a priority)

DONE Writing molecules: DONE, don't need to implement files writers for the moment
Writing sets of molecules: need to do that (not a priority)

Looping over Atoms and Bonds: need to do that (not a priority)

Ring Information: need to do that (not a priority)

DONE Modifying molecules: DONE

IN Progress (thegodone) Working with 2D molecules: GenerateDepictionMatching2DStructure, GenerateDepictionMatching3DStructure

IN Progress (thegodone) Working with 3D Molecules: UFFOptimizeMolecule, EmbedMultipleConfs, AlignMolConformers,GetConformerRMS

Preserving Molecules: can we do that ToBinary,  cPickle.dumps or should we use json instead?

Drawing Molecules: Draw, we need to svg for chrome not the files... ? MolsToGridImage can be interesting need to check for interaction with visualizer ?

In Progress (thegodone) [need helps] Substructure Searching: HasSubstructMatch, in progress GetSubstructMatches "how to return the lists like in python/should we return a list like in python ?"

Stereochemistry in substructure matches: need to test

Chemical Transformations: DeleteSubstructs, ReplaceSubstructs, ReplaceSidechains, ReplaceCore, GetMolFrags

Murcko Decomposition: GetScaffoldForMol, MakeScaffoldGeneric

Maximum Common Substructure: FindMCS, smartsString,

Fingerprinting and Molecular Similarity: FingerprintMol, FingerprintSimilarity, DiceSimilarity

MACCS Keys: GenMACCSKeys

Atom Pairs and Topological Torsions: GetAtomPairFingerprint,

almost DONE Morgan Fingerprints (Circular Fingerprints): GetMorganFingerprint, GetMorganFingerprintAsBitVect, in progress GetNonzeroElements

Picking Diverse Molecules Using Fingerprints: to do not a priority

Generating Similarity Maps Using Fingerprints: to do not a priority

DONE Descriptor Calculation: DONE, look if we can add others descriptors from obabel, cdk (not a priority) ???

Visualization of Descriptors: interesting!

Chemical Reactions: very interesting!

BRICS Implementation: very interesting!

Chemical Features and Pharmacophores: very interesting!

2D Pharmacophore Fingerprints: idem

Molecular Fragments

Database functionnalities: indexedDB interaction...

Inchi: to do not a priority
