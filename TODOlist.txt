This is the ToDo list


Need to find a way to have hierarchical Classes for example Molecule.Descriptors.

Need to have a Molecule.AllDescriptors to generate all of them (... list key:value).

How to use the  -s "EXPORT_NAME='RDKitjs'" to rename Module to RDKitjs in the js script also need to look at pre.js / post.js?

Look at the python getstart rdkit page for a list of missing functionnalities.

Reading and Writing Molecules: ok, don't need to implement files readers for the moment
Reading sets of molecules: need to do that!
Writing molecules: ok, don't need to implement files writers for the moment
Writing sets of molecules: need to do that!
Looping over Atoms and Bonds: to do (not priority)
Ring Information: to do
Modifying molecules: RemoveHs, Kekulize, SanitizeMol
Working with 2D molecules: Compute2DCoords, GenerateDepictionMatching2DStructure, GenerateDepictionMatching3DStructure
Working with 3D Molecules: UFFOptimizeMolecule, EmbedMultipleConfs, AlignMolConformers,GetConformerRMS
Preserving Molecules: can we do that ToBinary,  cPickle.dumps or should we use json instead?
Drawing Molecules: Draw, we need to svg for chrome not the files... ? MolsToGridImage can be interesting need to check for interaction with visualizer ?
Substructure Searching: HasSubstructMatch, GetSubstructMatches how to return the lists like in python/should we return a list like in python ?
Stereochemistry in substructure matches: need to test
Chemical Transformations: DeleteSubstructs, ReplaceSubstructs, ReplaceSidechains, ReplaceCore, GetMolFrags
Murcko Decomposition: GetScaffoldForMol, MakeScaffoldGeneric
Maximum Common Substructure: FindMCS, smartsString,
Fingerprinting and Molecular Similarity: FingerprintMol, FingerprintSimilarity, DiceSimilarity
MACCS Keys: GenMACCSKeys
Atom Pairs and Topological Torsions: GetAtomPairFingerprint,
Morgan Fingerprints (Circular Fingerprints): GetMorganFingerprint, GetMorganFingerprintAsBitVect, GetNonzeroElements
Picking Diverse Molecules Using Fingerprints: ...
Generating Similarity Maps Using Fingerprints: ...
Descriptor Calculation:
Visualization of Descriptors: interesting!
Chemical Reactions: very interesting!
BRICS Implementation: very interesting!
Chemical Features and Pharmacophores: very interesting!
2D Pharmacophore Fingerprints: idem
Molecular Fragments
Database functionnalities: indexedDB interaction...

General question: how to /can we handle two molecules in JS (for Tanimotosimilarity(mol1,mol2) = 0.78) ?
