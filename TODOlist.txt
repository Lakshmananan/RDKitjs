Improve the API:
1. Need to find a way to have hierarchical Classes for example Molecule.Descriptors.

2. Need to have a Molecule.AllDescriptors to generate all of them (... list key:value).

3. Can we have two molecules like for  Tanimotosimilarity(mol1,mol2) ?

Some examples to implement in the development stage:
Look at the python getstart rdkit page for a list of missing functionnalities.

Status : 28/05/2015 THEGODONE

FIX: create a empty molecule (but this is a workaround!)

DONE Reading and Writing Molecules: DONE, ok, we don't need to implement files readers for the moment, need to be done in Nodejs
Reading sets of molecules: need to do that (not a priority) need to be done in Nodejs

DONE Writing molecules: DONE, we don't need to implement files writers for the moment
Writing sets of molecules: need to do that (not a priority)

In progress: Looping over Atoms and Bonds: need to do that (not a priority) addAtom, addBond

Ring Information: need to do that (not a priority)

DONE Modifying molecules: done (MolOps)

IN Progress (thegodone) Working with 2D molecules: GenerateDepictionMatching2DStructure, GenerateDepictionMatching3DStructure

IN Progress (thegodone) Working with 3D Molecules: AlignMolConformers,GetConformerRMS

Done (thegodone) [issue return undefined] Preserving Molecules: MolToBinary

IN Progress (thegodone) Drawing Molecules: Drawing2D (done), we need to svg for chrome not the files... ? MolsToGridImage can be interesting need to check for interaction with visualizer ?

In Progress (thegodone) [need helps] Substructure Searching: HasSubstructMatch, in progress GetSubstructMatches "how to return the lists like in python/should we return a list like in python ?"

Stereochemistry in substructure matches: need to test

Chemical Transformations: DeleteSubstructs, ReplaceSubstructs, ReplaceSidechains, ReplaceCore, GetMolFrags

Done (thegodone):  Murcko Decomposition

Maximum Common Substructure: FindMCS, smartsString,

Almost done: Fingerprinting and Molecular Similarity: FingerprintMol done, FingerprintSimilarity done,MACCS done

to do : Atom Pairs and Topological Torsions: GetAtomPairFingerprint 

Done (thegodone) Morgan Fingerprints (Circular Fingerprints): GetMorganFingerprint done, GetMorganFingerprintAsBitVect done

to do: Picking Diverse Molecules Using Fingerprints: to do not a priority

to do: Generating Similarity Maps Using Fingerprints: to do not a priority

DONE Descriptor Calculation: DONE, look if we can add others descriptors from obabel, cdk (not a priority) ???

to do: Visualization of Descriptors: interesting!

to do: Chemical Reactions: very interesting!

to do: BRICS Implementation: very interesting!

to do: Chemical Features and Pharmacophores: very interesting!

to do: 2D Pharmacophore Fingerprints: idem

to do: Molecular Fragments

testing : Database functionnalities: indexedDB interaction... (http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.science.chemistry.rdkit.user/month=20140301 like for ORCALE ?)

Inchi: to do not a priority
